During this time, modern comic books were first published \n","and rapidly increased in popularity. The superhero archetype was created and many \n","well-known characters were introduced, including Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel \n","(later known as SHAZAM!), Captain America, and Wonder Woman.\n","Between 1939 and 1941 Detective Comics and its sister company, All-American Publications, \n","introduced popular superheroes such as Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, the Flash, \n","Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, the Atom, Hawkman, Green Arrow and Aquaman.[7] Timely Comics, \n","the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics, had million-selling titles featuring the Human Torch,\n","the Sub-Mariner, and Captain America.[8]\n","As comic books grew in popularity, publishers began launching titles that expanded \n","into a variety of genres. Dell Comics' non-superhero characters (particularly the \n","licensed Walt Disney animated-character comics) outsold the superhero comics of the day.[12] \n","The publisher featured licensed movie and literary characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck,\n","Roy Rogers and Tarzan.[13] It was during this era that noted Donald Duck writer-artist\n","Carl Barks rose to prominence.[14] Additionally, MLJ's introduction of Archie Andrews\n","in Pep Comics #22 (December 1941) gave rise to teen humor comics,[15] with the Archie \n","Andrews character remaining in print well into the 21st century.[16]\n","At the same time in Canada, American comic books were prohibited importation under \n","the War Exchange Conservation Act[17] which restricted the importation of non-essential \n","goods. As a result, a domestic publishing industry flourished during the duration \n","of the war which were collectively informally called the Canadian Whites.\n","The educational comic book Dagwood Splits the Atom used characters from the comic \n","strip Blondie.[18] According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book \n","characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety \n","about the questions posed by atomic power.[19] It was during this period that long-running \n","humor comics debuted, including EC's Mad and Carl Barks' Uncle Scrooge in Dell's Four \n","Color Comics (both in 1952).[20][21]\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","questions = [\"What superheroes were introduced between 1939 and 1941 by Detective Comics and its sister company?\",\n","             \"What comic book characters were created between 1939 and 1941?\",\n","             \"What well-known characters were created between 1939 and 1941?\",\n","             \"What well-known superheroes were introduced between 1939 and 1941 by Detective Comics?\"]\n","\n","for question in questions:\n","    inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(question, text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n","    #print(\"inputs\", inputs)\n","    #print(\"inputs\", type(inputs))\n","    input_ids = inputs[\"input_ids\"].tolist()[0]\n","    inputs.to(\"cuda\")\n","\n","    text_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids)\n","    answer_model = model(**inputs)\n","\n","    answer_start = torch.argmax(\n","        answer_model['start_logits']\n","    )  # Get the most likely beginning of answer with the argmax of the score\n","    answer_end = torch.argmax(answer_model['end_logits']) + 1  # Get the most likely end of answer with the argmax of the score\n","\n","    answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[answer_start:answer_end]))\n","\n","    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n","    print(f\"Answer: {answer}\\n\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_yTDQ6kn6pWS"},"source":["You can compare those results with those obtained using the pipeline, as you did in the previous lab.
